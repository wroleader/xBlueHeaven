# BlueHeaven - A Native WinForms Client for Bluesky!

This is a project born out of curiosity and the will to learn how to work and interact with the AT Protocol.
It is meant to be a super lightweight Bluesky Client built on WinForms that you can rely on without having to
indulge in the massive resource-hog that is a web browser or a WebApp.

It is meant to be simple, fast and reliable.
